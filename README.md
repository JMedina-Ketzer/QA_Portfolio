* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Process & Project Management
Demonstrated ability to manage testing workflows and sprint processes using industry-standard tools:
* **Trello:** Used for simulating Scrum/Agile sprint cycles, including backlog management, task prioritization, and progress tracking (similar to JIRA/Azure DevOps concepts).
