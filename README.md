# QA Portfolio: Automated Testing Projects

## Overview
This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing my skills in Quality Assurance (QA) and test automation, with focus on real-world scenarios and employability in the Portuguese market. It contains practical testing frameworks and automated tests developed with professional methodologies.

## Technologies Covered
- **API Testing:** Postman (Manual & Automated Flows, Data-Driven Testing, Environment Variables)
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Cypress
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Testing Methodologies:** Data-Driven Testing, Negative Testing, Boundary Testing

## Process & Project Management
Demonstrated ability to manage testing workflows and sprint processes using industry-standard tools:
- **Trello:** Used for simulating Scrum/Agile sprint cycles, including backlog management, task prioritization, and progress tracking (similar to JIRA/Azure DevOps concepts).

## Projects

### API Automation with Postman
- **Data-Driven Testing:** 9 test scenarios covering happy path, negative testing, edge cases, and security validation
- **Environment Management:** Multi-environment configuration (Dev/Production ready)
- **Automated Test Execution:** Collection Runner with CSV data files
- **Professional Results:** 21/26 tests passing with detailed analysis of API limitations
- **Key Learnings:** Real-world validation requirements vs API fake constraints

### Web Automation with Cypress
- **E2E Testing:** Foundational test scripts and setup for web application testing
- **Professional Structure:** Ready for expansion with additional test scenarios

## Technical Achievements
- Implemented data-driven testing strategies with external test data
- Configured environment variables for multi-stage testing
- Developed comprehensive negative testing scenarios
- Documented API limitations and testing workarounds
- Established professional test structure and reporting
